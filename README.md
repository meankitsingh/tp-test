Fill that array with the first 1000 prime numbers. Make the order random (non-consecutive). Return the filled array and print it in the console.

- [pandastest.py](https://github.com/meankitsingh/tp-test/pandastest.py) - Use the python library pandas to import some klines from any open API you can find and save them into a pandas dataframe.
